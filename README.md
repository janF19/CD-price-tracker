# CD Price Tracker üìà

A web application that tracks and visualizes price changes for trains running between Prague and Ostrava Svinov on the Czech Railways (ƒåesk√© dr√°hy) network. The system performs automated price scraping twice daily to analyze how train ticket prices fluctuate over time, providing insights into pricing patterns and variations between different trains and weeks.

## Overview üöÇ

This project monitors train ticket prices specifically for Friday departures from Prague to Ostrava Svinov after 13:20. By collecting price data twice daily (8 AM and 6 PM) starting one week before each Friday, the application enables users to:
- Observe price fluctuations over time
- Compare pricing patterns between different trains
- Analyze week-to-week variations in pricing strategies
- Identify trains with more frequent price changes

The analysis follows a "ceteris paribus" approach, focusing solely on price changes over time without accounting for factors like train capacity.
